Geodesign Hub Compatible Land Use Allocation Model

This model takes in gridded evaluation files and input features from Geodesign Hub (www.geodesignhub.com) and allocates them. 

Projection: Geodesign Hub uses EPSG 4326 / WGS 94 (http://epsg.io/4326) and all GeoJSON files should be in that projection.

This is the main file the other files are as follows: 
config.py: This file contains the configuration and input evaluation and features files and also settings for system prirority. 
GeodesignHub.py : This is the Geodesign Hub client written in Python, it is useful for interacting with the Geodesign Hub API. 
shapelyHelper.py: This file is a helper class for Shapely (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely) the Python library used for spatial analysis.
